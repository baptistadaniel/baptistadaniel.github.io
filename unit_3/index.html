	<h1>Music by those who love music</h1>

	<p>Trust the chills: the sound is straight up bona fide.<br>
	There's room for everything, it just has to sound good.<br>
	Musicario is that vibe that pulls you in.<br>
	It's party, it's chill, it's hard work, it's the weekend.<br>
	A place to add, share and amplify. Music is in charge here.<br>
	Inside, it's all Musicario.</p>
